# A3: Drawing Tools


## What do you want the user to feel when using these tools? What mood is this for? What is the user trying to do?

Fun! Create cool looking things and relax

## Describe your eraser. What does it do? 

Erases the entire screen to a mix between both colors

## Describe your 1st tool. What does it do? How is it used?
Drag around the screen to leave a trail of halloween themed emojis


## Describe your 2nd tool. What does it do? How is it used?
Drag around the screen to create raindrops with the first color from the color picker. They fall to the screen
and form a puddle on the bottom, which has some random movement via perlin noise 
(inspired by Dr. Kate's lecture, but coded from scratch). When raindrops hit the puddle, they create splashes. 
The puddle color is determined by an aggregate of the raindrop colors


## Describe your 3rd tool. What does it do? How is it used?
Drag around the screen to unveil a pattern in the background. The pattern is always the same, determined by modulo
operations from pixel position, but the underlying colors are affected by the color picker


## Describe your 4th tool. What does it do? How is it used?
Press on the screen to start a squiggle, drag to form the shape, and release to watch it move. The color is determined
by both from the color picker at the time of creation, 
and each individual squiggle has randomly generated frequencies and amplitudes of movement


## Which of your tools is continuous? What makes that different?
4th tool. It is different in that separate squiggles are formed that can have different properties, but each individual
squiggle moves and shifts in unison as one shape.


## Which of your tools uses begin/endshape? What are you doing with that feature?
4th tool. I am using it to create separate squiggles with varying properties
