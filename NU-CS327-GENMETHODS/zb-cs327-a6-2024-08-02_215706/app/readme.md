## What Tracery grammar did you make? What does it generate?

For the spooky bot I made a grammar for different types of spooky creatures that generates themed things for them to say

For the wave bot I made a grammar that generates descriptions of the waveforms

## What two complexifiers did you use? Describe how you used them, and what effect they have on your bot

For the spooky bot I have different moods. The moods represent different halloween themed creatures (zombie, vampire, etc). It causes the bot to say different things and appear differently in the chat, as well as display a different image in the panel

For the wave bot I have a p5 instance that displays waveforms based on what the bot and user type. The waveforms have amplitudes based on each word's length

## Look up the Gricean maxims. Do your bots obey them? Why or why not?

No. Both of my bots do not really respond to what the user says and do not comply with the quality principle

## Which bot do you like more?

Wave bot

-----------
# Bot #1 (Spooky)

## What should the user know about interacting with this bot (turn on sound, keywords to use, etc)

Different keywords appearing in what the user types will cause the bot to change into different moods (or clicking the random mood button)
1. Ghost: ghost, ectoplasm, boo, spirit, haunt
2. Vampire: vampire, blood, bat
3. Zombie: zombie, undead, brain
4. Skeleton: skeleton, skull, bone
5. Spider: spider, bug, insect, web

## Describe your bot's character

The different moods have different vibes
1. Ghost: Trying to scare you
2. Vampire: Wants blood
3. Zombie: Wants brains
4. Skeleton: Jokey
5. Spider: Friendly

## How does your bot listen, think, and speak?

It listens to text via the user chat, thinks by looking for keywords, and speaks by generating themed phrases

## How have your styled your page to best present this character? What scene or mood are you suggesting?

The chat panel is black with orange text for halloween, and the panel contains images of halloween decorations (from my house this year! We go all out)

## Describe the first thing this bot can respond to.  What is the expressive range of what you say in response?

It can respond to ghost themed keywords (see above). The expressive range is anything

## Describe the second thing this bot can respond to

It can respond to vampire themed keywords (see above)

## Describe the third thing this bot can respond to

It can respond to zombie themed keywords (see above)

-----------
# Bot #2 (Wave)

## What should the user know about interacting with this bot (turn on sound, keywords to use, etc)

No keywords. Type things in the chat, see the resulting wave form, see the bot's response

## Describe your bot's character

It's very encouraging and enjoys the user's waveforms

## How does your bot listen, think, and speak?

It listens to the text input from the user. It thinks by analyzing the number and length of words said. It speaks by being amazed the waveforms, and displaying a resulting waveform

## How have your styled your page to best present this character? What scene or mood are you suggesting?

The style of the panel is very clean. The chat is colored the same as the waveform, very colorful and fun

## Describe the first thing this bot can respond to.  What is the expressive range of what you say in response?

This bot can respond to the number of words you type


## Describe the second thing this bot can respond to

This bot can respond to the length of words you type


## Describe the third thing this bot can respond to

This bot can respond to the appearance of your waveform
