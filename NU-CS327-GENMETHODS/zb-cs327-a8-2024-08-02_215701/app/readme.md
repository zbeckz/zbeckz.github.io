# A7: Data Essay

### Your Glitch link

https://zb-cs327-a8.glitch.me

### Two techniques from A3-A7 and how you used them here

1. Drawing Tool - in my lightning mask if any of your fingers are in the upper half of the screen it draws lightning
2. Particle System - in my meteor mask the meteors are particles with position and velocity

### Which was your favorite mask that you made, and why?

Lightning mask. I think the theming is cool. Your character is made of storm clouds and you can shoot lightning from your fingertips whilst floating through the sky

# Mask 1 (Lightning)

### Describe this mask

This mask makes your face and hands look like stormclouds by drawing things at each landmark. When a fingertip landmark is on the upper half of the screen, it draws lightning bolts up from the tips to the top of the screen. The background is a blue sky with randomly generated clouds moving to make it appear like your character is flying through the sky

###  What three additional controls did you add? Why would the user want to adjust that?

1. Cloud size - adjusts the size of the clouds that make up your character. The user might want to adjust their appearance
2. Lightning size - adjusts the thickness of lightning bolts. The user might want to customize their magical powers
3. Lightning color - adjusts the color of lightning bolts. Same reason as above

### What did you do for the hands and the environment? Why is that the right choice for this mask?

The hands are storm clouds, the environment is a sky with bigger, less stormy clouds flying by. This creates the effect of you being a cloud creature flying through the sky

### What secondary motion does this mask have? How does the tracking data affect this motion?

The lightning bolts shoot out from fingertips. The tracking data of the fingertips affects where the lightning is

### Of the ontology in class (mirror, mask, puppet, costume, environment, dance partner) which one(s) best describe this mask and why?

Mirror / Costume

# Mask 2

### Describe this mask

You are a space creature who's hands grow in size when you eat meteors


###  What three additional controls did you add? Why would the user want to adjust that?

1. Meteor Frequency: how often do meteors spawn
2. Meteor Speed: how fast to meteors move
3. Random Movement: to what extent do meteor's trajectories randomly shift

For all of the above, the user may want to adjust to change the difficulty / ease of the gameplay

### What did you do for the hands and the environment? Why is that the right choice for this mask?

The hands grow in size when catching a meteor, the environment is outer space with twinkling stars. The hands give feedback to the user, the environment sets the meteor scene

### What secondary motion does this mask have? How does the tracking data affect this motion?

The meteors flying by are secondary motion - they respond to the tracking data because if they collide with the mouth landmarks they despawn

### Of the ontology in class (mirror, mask, puppet, costume, environment, dance partner) which one(s) best describe this mask and why?

Mirror
