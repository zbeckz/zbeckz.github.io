https://brutalist-web.design/ (found via a suggestion in Dr. Compton's twitter thread)
 

### Your 3 insights from the readings 

From Stop Stealing Sheep, I learned that the way information is presented, both placement and style, is often chosen by experts for profressional institutions. Subtle things that aren't even visible to an untrained eye can shape the way the reader takes in information. From Brutalist Web Design, I was given the advice that decoration should only be added when needed and there is no need for unnecessary content. My goal was to keep my design simple, so this brutalist method fits my vision. Also from Brutalist Web Design I realized the importance of letting the design of elements speak to their function. Hyperlinks should be underlined. Hovering over a button should change its appearance and cause the cursor to change design.
 
### Describe the visual style of your page
 
My page is intended to be simple and easy on the eyes while conveying all the information it needs to. I wanted it to be concise and follow the 3 insights above. The overall color scheme is a gradient of shades of light blue. This was chosen very intentionally - I am red/green colorblind so using blues allows me to better understand what the typical user experience will be on my website and holds true to my identity. The way the assignments are displayed and are allowed to be interacted with shows that they are not yet completed but that they will be in the future.
