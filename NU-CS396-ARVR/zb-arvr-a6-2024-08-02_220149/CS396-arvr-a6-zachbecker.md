# A6: Group AFrame hangout spot

### Your name:

Zach Becker
 
 
### What were your three insights

From Isbister and Muellers's Movement Based Game Guidelines: It is important to consider the cognitive load of movement and learning new moves - don't overwhelm the user.
From Oculus's VR Locomotion Design Guide: Teleportation can cause the user to feel disoriented due to the sudden change in perspective - adding sound effects and visual effects simultaneously with the teleportation can help
From GDC's How NOT to Build a VR Arcade Game: You can simulate G-forces, which is vital to preventing motion sickness
 
 
### Describe your app

My app is a fully textured baseball field with farmland surrounded by woods as a skybox background. There is a baseball on a tee at home plate which, when clicked, flies in a random trajectory into the field and resets once it hits the ground. There is a big scoreboard past the centerfield fence which has pictures of my dog, Gus, that can be changed when clicked.
 

### What are 3 words to capture the mood of your app

Playful, fun, outdoorsy
   
### How are your avatars built?

The legs are made up of a light gray cylinder meant to resemble a baseball jersey. The head is the same sphere and cone nose from the starter code, color determined randomly. There is a hat made up of a hemisphere and semicircle, each of which has customizable color. Each avatar also has a glove and bat which come from .glb files.

   
### What are your three ways that players can customize their avatar?

Hat color, hat bill color, side of body the glove/bat are on


### How do players move, and what from the readings makes you think that is safe to not trigger motion-sickness?

Movement at a constant speed should help prevent motion sickness because there is no acceleration and thus no disagreement between your ears and eyes.


### What is your "cheese plate"? (a thing you can interact with) How will that give players something to talk about?

The scoreboard in center field displays photos of my dog, Gus. Players can click on the photo to scroll through various photos of him and discuss how cute he is :)
 
 
### What is your "chat pet"? (a mode or timed event) How will that give players something to talk about?

The baseball sitting on the tee on home plate will be launched into the field when clicked. Once it lands it will be reset to the tee and the distance the ball traveled will be displayed on the controls section in the top left
 
### What postmortem did you watch, and what did they recommend for movement or interaction?

GDC: How NOT to build a VR arcade game. They recommended not using yaw for motion to prevent motion sickness, as well as simulated G-forces.
 
  
### How can users move around your scnee

N/A

### Why would someone want to spend time with friends in your virtual space?

For many, being on a baseball field with friends is a very nostalgic scene. For those who didn't ever have that experience irl, they can hopefully enjoy the scenery and the dog photos!
 
 
### PLAYTESTING: list 3 people who playtested your game and summarize their feedback

Amy Guo, Richard Jo, and Will Cohen
They all liked that the baseball field is all textured parts instead of a singular image and being able to choose what side your glove is on. Will suggested having a moving ball, which was a great idea and I did add!

### PLAYTESTING: describe 3 games you playtested and what you learned

Glizzy Gladiators: Their customizable hot dog avatars were super fun and showed how something so not human like can really feel like you.
Draw The Joker: The idea of a card game in VR was very intriguing to me because it seems like something that could be fun, though games where reading the other's players body language is important may not work
Snowman playing game: The snowmen gave the scene a very festive vibe which goes to show how immersive vr can feel.
 
 
### VR TESTING: What did you notice most when you played "First Steps" (or other hand-tracked VR)?

Being able to move (albeit in a limited space) around the scene rather than just tilt your head like with a cardboard is a huge upgrade in terms of immersiveness
 
### VR TESTING: How did First Steps use your hands that you couldn't replicate with a mouse/keyboard? 

It feels way different between able to reach out into space and grab things rather than dragging and clicking a mouse. It is also nice being able to use both your hands simultaneously as opposed to a single mosue.
 
### FINAL THOUGHTS: Do you think AR/VR will be more or less popular worldwide by next spring's class? Why?

I think it's more likely to be more popular than less popular purely as it becomes more accessible and more games are able to be developed, though I would not bet on it being a significant difference.
 
  
### FINAL THOUGHTS: Did you see anything in this class (your work, others' work, examples) that you think could really take off in VR in a way that we haven't seen before?

No
 
 
### FINAL THOUGHTS: What would make VR work when it hasn't before?

VR headsets that come with haptic feedback and a way to feel like you are physically moving around the screen (like a treadmill type thing at your feet) could vastly increase the possibilities for vr spaces. Some of this stuff already exists I know, but if it were perfected and made more accessible i think vr would greatly increase in popularity.
